productId uniqueness

UI Layout

table layout

form layout

buttons & alignment

✅ Commit Message Convention (VERY IMPORTANT)

Use imperative, present tense:

type: short description

Allowed types
feat     → new feature
fix      → bug fix
refactor → code restructuring
style    → UI / CSS only
chore    → setup / config

🔀 Merge Strategy (What your trainer expects)

Create feature branch from develop

Work only on that feature

Commit cleanly

Merge feature → develop

After all features → merge develop → main

main
└── develop
    |-- feature/html-setup
    ├── feature/core-crud
    ├── feature/filter-sort
    └── feature/routing-validation
